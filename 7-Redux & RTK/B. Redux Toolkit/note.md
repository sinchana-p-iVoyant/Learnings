# NOTE:
# EXTRA REDUCERS:
<!-- v - 23 -->
- In redux, each reducer can update only its portion of the application state.
- However, it can can respond to any other action dispatched in the application.
- (for e.g. refer "index6.js" in ---> "REDUX" folder)

- In REDUX-TOOLKIT, this does not happen
- by default, reducers from one createSlice, will only respond to the action types generated by the same SLICE.
- If u want a slice to respond to other action types besides the types ithas generated,
- u'll need to make use of "EXTRA REDUCERS" 

- EXTRA REDUCERS, as name indicates are additional reducers apart from the reducer generated by createSlice.
